# ⚛️ Archetype React ![archetype react badge](https://github.com/juniorconquista/archetype-react/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

> This template aims to accelerate the start of a react project using Create React App, it already provides basic quality settings and project standardizations.

## 💻 Tech stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) declarative component-centric UI
- [React router dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for manager routing
- [Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) for testing web pages by querying and interacting with DOM nodes
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for matchers and mocks in unit tests

## 🚀 Start developing

- **Install dependencies**

  Get all dependencies installed by running

  ```shell
  $ npm install
  // or
  $ yarn
  ```

- **Setting up the project**

  ```shell
  $ yarn prepare-husky
  ```

- **Start developing**

  ```shell
  # development
  $ yarn start

  # production mode (locally)
  $ yarn build && yarn serve
  ```

  Project should be running at http://localhost:3000

- **Create _.env_ file with all settings the application will need to run. There is a _.env.example_ file in the root of project's directory which you can use as a model for that.**

## 📚 General informations

- This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- **Naming standards**

  ```shell
  # branch
  feat/description

  # commit
  feat: description
  ```

  The total length of characters allowed cannot exceed 52 characters, this is done by normalization of kubernetes and helm (herramienta that is used to deploy every month).

  Every branch the name of ms, must be DNS Compliant, and only decide that rare characters are not accepted (#, $, %, \_ , etc), we only allow el - y la /.

  To standardize our commits we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages

- **Linter**

  ```shell
  # find problems
  $ yarn lint

  # find and fix problems automatically
  $ yarn lint:fix

  ```

- **Unit tests**

  ```shell
   # run all unit tests
   $ yarn test

   # run all the tests and watch for changes in related files
   $ yarn test:watch

   # run tests only on changed files
   $ yarn test:staged

   # run all unit tests generates the coverage report in the coverage folder in the project root
   $ yarn test:coverage

   # run all unit tests generates the coverage report in the coverage folder in the project root and watch changes in related files
   $ yarn test:watch:coverage
  ```

- **Hooks**

  This project has these hooks:

  - `pre-commit`: perform static code analysis with eslint
  - `commit-msg`: validates the commit message according to the convention adopted by the project
  - `pre-push`: perform unit testing of project components and integration tests

## 📁 Folder and file structures

- For best practices to structure files please read this [document](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide#structure-files-as-feature-folders-with-single-file-logic)

- To learn a little more about how we write the types of our entities, see the documentation for our [type package](https://github.com/TiendaNube/partners-portal/blob/stable/src/types/README.md)

- To create a component or utility, it must first be determined its type, in order to select a directory in which to create the corresponding files:

  - It would be created within the **app** in case they are app's own features
  - It would be created inside **commons** in case of multi-domain general-purpose utilities.
  - It would be created inside **components** in case the component is used in multiple domains.
  - It would be created within **domains** if it centralizes the logical and visual representation according to the domain
    - Each domain would have thair own route file that specifies the route where it belongs
    - In case of a necessity of creating a subdomain directory, a new directory would be created called **pages** and it would group all pages of a domain.
  - It would be created inside the subdirectories of **domains/components** in case the component will only be used in the views of a specific domain.
    - If a page needs to use a component, this component would be created inside **domains/MyDomain/components** as well.
    - If a page needs to be divided to decrease its complexity, this division would be created in **domains/MyDomain/pages/MyPage/widgets** directory.
  - It would be created within the **domains/hooks** subdirectories if the hook was only used within a specific domain
  - It would be created inside **hooks** in case the hook is used in multiple domains.

  ```
   ├─ 📁 app
   ├─ 📁 commons
   ├─ 📁 components
   └─ 📁 domains
      └─ 📁 Auth
         ├─ 📁 components
         ├─ 📁 pages
         |  └─ 📁 Login
         |     └─ 📁 widgets
         └─ 📁 hooks
  ```

- The directory should have the same name as the component. The component file should have the name of the component in Pascal Case format and the extension `.tsx`.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  └─ 📄 Login.tsx
  ```

- Every directory should contain a 📄 **index.ts** which serves as an entry point for the module, component, utils and/or hooks.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  └─ 📄 Login.tsx
  ```

- Every component, utils and/or hooks should come with a test. The test must have the same name as the file being tested and the extension must be `.spec.tsx`

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 Login.tsx
  │  └─ 📄 login.spec.tsx
  ```

- The types for the component will be written in `.ts` file using the same component name in camel case format and the `types` prefix.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 Login.tsx
  │  ├─ 📄 login.spec.tsx
  │  ├─ 📄 login.styled.scss
  │  └─ 📄 login.types.ts
  ```

- The Definitions for the component as `constants` will be written to a `.ts` file using the same component name in camel case format and the prefix `definitions`.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 Login.tsx
  │  ├─ 📄 login.definitions.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 login.spec.tsx
  │  ├─ 📄 login.styled.scss
  │  └─ 📄 login.types.ts
  ```

- If a subcomponents contains subcomponents (widgets), they should have their own module subdirectory inside the same components directory.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📁 widgets
  │  │  ├─ 📁 Form
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 form.styled.scss
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 Form.tsx
  │  │  │  └─ 📄 form.spec.tsx
  |  |  |─ 📁 FormsSubcomponent
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 FormsSubcomponent.styled.scss
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 FormsSubcomponent.tsx
  │  │  │  └─ 📄 FormsSubcomponent.spec.tsx
  │  │  └─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 login.styled.scss
  │  ├─ 📄 Login.tsx
  │  └─ 📄 login.spec.tsx
  ```

  - In the case of hooks, their names should start by the prefix **use** and use Camel Case format and have the extension `.ts` or `.tsx`. They should be contained in a directory with the same name, along with an index file and its corresponding test `.spec.ts` or `.spec.tx`.

  ```
  ├─ 📁 Login
  │  ├─ 📁 hooks
  │  │  ├─ 📁 useCount
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  │  │  ├─ 📄 useCount.ts
  │  │  │  └─ 📄 useCount.spec.ts
  │  │  └─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 index.ts
  │  ├─ 📄 login.styled.scss
  │  ├─ 📄 Login.tsx
  │  └─ 📄 login.spec.tsx
  ```

## 🤖 Component coding

- The component should have the same name as the file using Pascal Case format. It should be declared in a Arrow Function, always typying the expected answer and making the default export at the end of the file.

  ```jsx
  // Login.tsx
  import React from 'react';

  const Login: React.FC = () => <div>...</div>;

  export default Login;
  ```

- If the component has props, they will be imported from the corresponding `.definitions.ts` file adding initial prefix corresponding to their type. Example interface ` ILogin`, type `TLogin`, enum `ELogin`.

  ```jsx
  // Login.tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { ILogin } from './login.types';

  const Login: React.FC<ILogin> = ({ title, description }: ILogin) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );

  export default Login;
  ```

- The index file will be responsible for exporting everything needed form the module. Especially, the component's default.

  ```jsx
  // index.ts
  export { default } from './Login';
  ```

## 🧪 Testing

- For testing best practices, please read this [document](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library).
- To create a test is necessary to import from the testing library both the render and the screen.

  ```jsx
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
  ```

- The component to be tested should also be imported.

  ```jsx
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
  import Login from './Login';
  ```

- The heading of the tests must be written following the order Given-When-Then [Documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)

  - **Given** represents a precondition
  - **When** an action
  - **Then** a result or consequence of the action (user acceptance criteria).
  - **And** a result or consequence of other consequence (user acceptance criteria).
  - **But** a result which should not be possibly observable

  ```jsx
    import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
    import ComponentExample from "./ComponentExample";

    describe("GIVEN a ComponentExample", () => {
      describe("WHEN rendered", () => {
        it("THEN should display the correct text", () => {
          ...
        });
      });
    });
  ```

- In this first instance, we will verify the right rendering of the component by checking the text in each of the elements.

  ```jsx
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
  import Login from './Login';

  describe('GIVEN a Login', () => {
    describe('WHEN rendered', () => {
      it('THEN should display the correct text', () => {
        render(<Login title="title" description="description" />);
        expect(screen.getByText(/title/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
        expect(screen.getByText(/description/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
  });
  ```
